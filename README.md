# ChernoTracing

A ray tracing project based off of an educational YouTube series by Cherno ([GitHub](https://github.com/TheCherno), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheChernoProject)).  The first video in the series can be found here: [Welcome to Ray Tracing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfW1Fhd9u9Q).

The intent of this project is to follow the video series while implementing it in a style that is consistent with my own development experience.
